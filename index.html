<h1 class="iam"> "I am" Poem </h1>
<p> I am quiet but energetic <br>
  I wonder about what I'll do about my future <br>
  I am willing to try new things <br>
</p>

<p>
  I love doing things outside of school like dragonboat and bowling. Dragonboat is a way for me to connect with people who all have a similar goal. To compete and push each other to our limits.
</p>

<p>
  Video games is a way for me to sometimes escape the pressure of reality, like schoolwork which might be a large stress source for me. It lets me connect with others that I don't get to connect with that much due to different school circumstances.
